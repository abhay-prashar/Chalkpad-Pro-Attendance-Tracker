# ✅ Chalkpad Pro Attendance Tracker Extension for Chitkara Students

**Chalkpad Pro Attendance Tracker** is a lightweight and powerful Chrome extension built specifically for **Chitkara University students**.  
It helps you instantly check how many classes you can safely **bunk** (or how many you need to attend) — right inside your Chalkpad Pro attendance page.

---

## 🎯 Built for 75% Attendance Rule

This extension works with the **75% attendance criteria** followed at Chitkara.  
It tells you for **each subject**:

- ✅ How many more classes you can **safely miss** while staying above 75%
- ⚠️ How many **extra classes you need to attend** if you're below 75%

---

## 💡 What It Does

When you open the **attendance section** in Chalkpad Pro:

- A new column appears for each subject
- It shows either:
  - `✔️ Bunkable: X classes` — if you're above 75%
  - `❗Attend: X more classes needed` — if you're below 75%
- All calculations are based on total and attended classes

> 📌 **Note:** This extension calculates class-wise. If you have **2 classes in a day**, it will count **2 separately**. So plan your bunks accordingly.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer:** While this extension is made to help you, **always cross-check your final attendance manually** for full safety. Don’t rely blindly.
